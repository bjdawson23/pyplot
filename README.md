# Matplotlib and pyplot

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

## Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)

### Activate Virtual Environment Before Installing Packages

* create a local virtual environment in your repo (e.g. in the .venv folder) and activate it (this option offers more practice with environments), OR
* create a virtual environment for the course somewhere on your machine and reuse that (this option saves space).
* install packages (e.g. requests, spacy, spacytextblob)

#### python -m pip install matplotlib
